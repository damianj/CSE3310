# CSE3310 Term Project: Dodgy Dive
Our project involved making an obstacle dodging game. We ended up using the LibGDX framework to facilitate the game making process. Most of the assets were pulled from the internet and modified in some way. The premise of the game is simple, as the player you must dodge any sharks that come your way and you must stay within the boundaries of the screen. Your score is determined by how long you've stayed alive. The in game music volume, background, character costume, and difficulty are all adjustable in some way from a settings screen. There are also scoreboard, and credits screens that show the top 5 scores and developers of the game, respectively.
