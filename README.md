# CSE3310 Term Project
Our project involved making an obstacle dodging game. We ended up using the LibGDX framework to facilitate the game making process. Most of the assets were pulled from the internet and modified in some way. The premise of the game is simple, as the player you must dodge any sharks that come your way and you must stay within the boundaries of the screen. Your score is determined by how long you've stayed alive and difficulty scales with time.
